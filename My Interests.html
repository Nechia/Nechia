			<h2 id="text">I am more concerned about what is happening around the world. Especially when it comes to humans, their well being, gender equality and etc. It is a matter of seeing someone else happy at the end of the day, by incoporating all the social well being elements!I am all about making the world better, and as much as my means will not reach the whole world, we all have to start somewhere.</h2>

			<h3 id="text">In the future I would really love to build a Safe Heaven in my home town. That will focus on building my community, from toodlers, teenagers , women and men. My inspiration is drawn from growing up in a community where a lot of people do not actually make it in life, old woman are being raped by younger man and children are going to bed with an empty stomach or either grow up without guidance and a safe home. Therefore, it bothers me a lot and if you have a problem with something, it is either you fix it or die from it.</h3>
